# Projects

## Scoping agents to a codebase

A project pairs a directory on disk with agent instances. Instances share the project directory as their `cwd`, but each gets its own `.worktrees/<agent>-<random>` scratch dir so agents don't collide.

### Project metadata file

Each project has a metadata file at `~/.claude/projects/<id>/project.md`:

```markdown
---
id: acme-web
name: Acme Web
description: The main marketing site.
cwd: /home/parlamentas/Documents/Lab/acme-web
roster:
  - agent: developer
    instance: developer-3f9a
    label: main
    unit: blue/warrior
  - agent: qa-visual
    instance: qa-visual-b2c1
---

# Project memory

Any prose here is injected as the project memory when any instance runs.
```

Anything after the closing `---` is the **project memory** (see [Memory](#/memory)).

### Roster instance fields

| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `agent` | Slug of the agent definition to instantiate. |
| `instance` | Unique ID for this instance (auto-generated on drop). |
| `label` | Optional human-readable name — shown next to the avatar. |
| `unit` | Optional avatar override — `faction/kind`. Defaults derived from agent slug. |
| `model` | Optional per-instance model override. Uses the agent default if unset. |
| `effort` | Optional per-instance effort override. |
| `worktree` | Path of the git worktree created for this instance. Auto-cleaned on removal. |

### Worktree isolation

When a project directory is a git repo, each rostered instance gets its own worktree at `<projectRoot>/.worktrees/<agent>-<instance>`. Agents write there; the human syncs to the main checkout at the end of each task via the sync script embedded in the agent body (see [Concepts → Worktree](#/concepts) for why).

If the project directory is NOT a git repo, the instance runs directly in `cwd` — no worktree isolation. Multiple non-git instances SHOULD be avoided to prevent conflicting edits.

### Project memory

The project memory tier is written to the same `project.md` file after the closing frontmatter. Edit from the app's **Project Memory** page or in your editor of choice. Maximum size is 256 KB.

### Uploads

Files attached to any run for the project are stored at `~/.claude/projects/<id>/_uploads/`. Available at `GET /api/projects/:id/uploads`.

### Git status widget

The Project card shows a compact git status: branch, ahead/behind, uncommitted-file count. Data comes from `GET /api/projects/:id/git-status`.

### Actions

The project detail page exposes buttons that shell out to the terminal:

| Action | Endpoint | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Open folder | `POST /api/projects/:id/open-folder` | `xdg-open` the project directory |
| Dev server | `POST /api/projects/:id/dev` | Detects available package managers + dev script, spawns in a terminal |
| Build | `POST /api/projects/:id/build` | Runs the build script in a terminal |
| Install | `POST /api/projects/:id/install` | Runs `pnpm/npm/yarn install` |
| Clear cache | `POST /api/projects/:id/clear-cache` | Wipes `.next/`, `dist/`, `.turbo/` |

Any process launched this way is captured by the Processes panel (see [Usage](#/usage)).
